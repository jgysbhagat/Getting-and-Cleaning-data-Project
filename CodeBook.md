# Following variables are contained in the Dataset in tidy dataset
"1" "subjects"
There are 30 subjects.
"2" "ActivityLabels" 
There are 6 labels:
WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,  STANDING,  LAYING
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3.axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.These time domain signals were captured at a 
constant rate of 50Hz.
Fast Fourier Transformation was applied to some of the signals.
The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity Acceleration signals.
Then the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk
signals (time.BodyAccelerationJerk and time.BodyGyroscopeJerk).
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3.axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
